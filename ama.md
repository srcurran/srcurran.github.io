overview: <p>The American Medical Association is a largest organization of physicians in the united states. With that they have a lot of content on their website. Our goal was to create a clean, simple, expansible website that could accommodate a wide-variety of content for physicians in various stages of their career (medical student, resident, physician, practice manager).</p>

challenge: <p>We had several goals that all needed to be accounted for&#58; Increase member registration, allow fast access to key content areas (continuing medical education, fellowship database, CPT information), create usable paths to deep-dive content (Meeting highlights form the LGBTQ Membership Groupâ€™s annual meeting), promote new content from JAMA & their news wire.</p>

solution: <p>This project was a classic website redesign & re-org for a large-scale organization. Over the five-month project we focused on creating a solution that would work as well on the day it launches as it will in several yeras. A focus was put on creating a strong heirarchy and a flexible design system.</p>

feature1-title: Design Research
feature1-content: <p>Across several phases of the project we worked with both stakeholders and users to deepen our understanding & validate our findings. The project began with a large group exercise where we discovered both the key goals of the different users of our site as well as the key content from each section (and where it falls within the flows of various user's needs). As the project was on-going, we would often use design excersises (including card sorting and rapid prototyping) to ensure we were finding the best solutions. Nearing the end of the UX phase we conducted several usability studies in a variety of markets to test, improva and validate our designs.</p>

feature3-title: Template & Modular Design System
feature3-content: <p>A master set of 9 templates and nearly 100 individual modules were used to create the final AMA website. Each module was wireframes (across 3 break-points), annotated & put into a master functional requirements document that contained all necessary information.</p>

feature4-title: Navigational Pages
feature4-content: <p>Many sites try to have their navigational pages do too much work our goal was to get users directly to the content as fast as possible. This put the focus on navigation patterns that work hard (multi-level navigation units; jump navigation for longer content pages)</p>

feature5-title: Component Inventory
feature5-content: <p>With a project as large as this, it is important to stay organized. We used a variety of tactics, including a large Functional Requirements Document, to ensure that we were accounting for every template, component and page.</p>
