					<p>It’s 1982 - A brand new IBM iSeries is put online. This massive mainframe computer is going to solve all your problems.</p> 
<p>It’s 2017 - The IBM mainframe is still running the show. It is no longer solving all your problems. Updates take the system offline for hours, new members get batch uploaded daily, features are nearly impossible to implement, daily tasks require deep system knowledge.</p>
<p>LegalShield is a subscription-based legal services provider. It has been around for over 40 years, and the technology that the platform was built on had started to show its age. We were challenged to create a new LegalShield application leaving the technical constraints of the past behind us.</p>

				<h2>The Challenge</h2>
				<p>Our goal was to re-design the experience on a new platform, from the ground up. This project was a “redesign” but felt much more like a new product launch. We worked in agile sprints directly with the development team to create the experience piece-by-piece. Each decision was concepted, validate, designed and implemented. We worked primarily in a siloed manner with bi-weekly reviews provided a chance to present our work and findings to the larger organization.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="solution">
				<div class="solution-copy">
					<h2>The Solution </h2>
					<p>Across six months of sprints, we designed out, feature-by-feature an MVP across four different connected applications (member, administrator, provider and re-seller). Each step of the way was a delicate balance of user, business and technology needs. </p>

						<h5>Feature:</h5>
						<h3>Registration & Plan Selection</h3>
						<p>We wanted to make it as easy as possible to get access to membership. This included&#58; optimizing the registration form (reducing the number of fields, using best practice form design), allowing for multiple registration paths & payment solutions. In addition to the registration, flows were designed to manage multiple account options.</p>

						<h3>Communication</h3>
						<p>The core of the app is to facilitate connections between you and your attorney. We created an experience to facilitate communication between members & providers. The experience supported a wide variety of communication means including messages, phone calls & form uploads. This same platform was able to be abstracted from the outset to support multiple communication paths (member to provider, member to administrator, provider to provider). Additional features were designed to be implemented as necessary, such as allowing for multiple providers on a single case (with internal notes & different statuses), file uploads, chat, and IA workflow automation. </p>

						<h5>Feature: </h5>
						<h3>Experience Audits</h3>
						<p>With design often happening faster than our small development team's velocity, we were able to devote cycles to an in-depth exploration of different feature sets (app vs responsive web; freemium vs free-trial, onboarding, personalization, etc.) to help us inform future sprints and fill our backlog.</p>

						<h5>Feature:</h5>
						<h3>Multiple Users, Multiple Platforms</h3>
						<p>We had to design a system that worked not just *for* multiple audiences, but *across* multiple platforms, each with many nuanced use cases.  Members would have a legal need & request communication with a law firm; law firms had to offload clients that they had conflicts with; operations staff had to support both members & providers as well as run metrics. A fourth group, associates, sold plans to members & had a complex set of business rules that needed to be accounted for & supported in the design system.</p>

				<h2>My Role</h2>
				<p>I ran the UX portion of the project, working closely with the product owner & lead developer to define features, deliverables and the overall focus of the project. I worked with a mid-level UX designer & ensured a high-quality final product. </p><p>Our team was 100% remote with key players in Maine, Colorado, Washington, Oklahoma & NYC. We utilized a wide-variety of applications to facilitate design.</p>
