			<h2>Overview</h2>

				<div class="overview">
					<p>This is one of those projects that sticks with you. The project began with the client pushing to see more out-there explorations and never slowed down from there. Every step of the project was exciting as it was challenging. </p><p>Unfortunately, this project does not have a happy ending, mid-way through the client decided to no long work with the design team. The UX portion of the project continued for several more months until it was completed. However, I am unclear as to the current status of the project (I assume the project was shelved, but when we began the project the estimated completion was 2018 so one day I may wake up surprised).</p><p>That being said, I am very proud of the work created and have decided that it is a story worth telling.</p>

				<h2>The Challenge</h2>
				<p>Starbucks is a magical brand to work on, the brand loyalty is through the roof & the internal teams push to innovate and change. They came to Sapient in 2014 with a responsive site and mobile app that many considered best in class. The ask was to create a website that was years ahead of any other competitor while still driving to stores, online sales and encouraging more loyalty.</p>

				<div class="solution-copy">
					<h2>The Solution </h2>
					<p>The design phase of the project had two distinct chapters. The first chapter focused on creative exploration & concept development, this is where we came up with unique approaches to navigation and content exploration. The second, longer, chapter focused on the creation of assets - wireframes, page diagrams, sitemaps & flows.</p>

						<h3>Creative Exploration</h3>
						<p>With most redesigns of this scale, you expect to be pushed back by the client. After the initial presentation of wireframe and design explorations, we were pushed forward. From there we concepted several unique approaches to content and navigation.</p> <p>"Dig Dug" (shown) was a design where all elements were shown in a priority ranking on the homepage & to dig into deeper content you filtered the results. The selected option "Stacker" put the focus on moving both vertically & horizontally through the site. </p>

						<h3>Stacker Page Navigation</h3>
						<p>The Stakcer navigation model allowed users to navigate traditionally though a site using links and the back button. The real power lied in the ability to navigate across sections (from coffee to tea, or from dark roast to light roast). This navigational construct was the key concept of the site and was continually refined.</p>

						<h3>Combining Sales & Marketing</h3>
						<p>The existing Starbucks website was siloed between the eCommerce experience (get coffee mugs delivered to your house) and the marketing/in-store experience (find your closest Starbucks). A lot of effort was put into understanding the eCommerce platform and how to streamline product sales. At the same time we had to not drive customers away that were simply looking for store hours or their rewards points balance. </p>

						<h3>Sprint Based Design</h3>
						<p>Once the final concept was chosen. We developed a sitemap and user stories to ensure our design met all of the criteria. Though we were not partnered with an agile development team, this project used stories to ensure that when we were designing, we were ensured to design for all pages and corner cases. </p>

						<h3>Store Finder</h3>
						<p>Designing a store finder for Starbucks is akin to designing a Yelp. We needed to come up with a solution that worked just as well across a variety of cases, from finding a Reserve location in an urban center, to a drive-through store in the suburbs, to just show me the nearest open location. With all the pertinent information available from the locator screen, the goal was to make it as fast as possible to get to your cup of coffee.</p><p>For those looking for a little bit more, we treated the individual store pages as destinations in their own right. In addition to hours and an address, we featured content from what beans were being featured this month to what track is currently playing. Adding more of a community coffee shop vibe, we designed an optional Community Board that could be moderated by a store manager.</p>

			<div class="my-role">
				<h2>My Role</h2>
				<p>I started on the project shortly after the discovery/research phase had completed. The team was very bare bones for a project this size and consisted of a producer, CD, UXD, UX lead (myself) and occasional support from Jr UX designers. The concepting portion of the project was collaborative with the CD. The majority of the UX deliverables were produced independently. The project plan and client communication was primarily handled by myself with feedback and direction from the he producer and UXD.</p>
