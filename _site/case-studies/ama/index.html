			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<div class="project-overview">
				<div class="overview">
					<p>The American Medical Association is a largest organization of physicians in the united states. With that they have a lot of content on their website. Our goal was to create a clean, simple, expansible website that could accommodate a wide-variety of content for physicians in various stages of their career (medical student, resident, physician, practice manager).</p>

				<h2>The Challenge</h2>
				<p>We had several goals that all needed to be accounted for&#58; Increase member registration, allow fast access to key content areas (continuing medical education, fellowship database, CPT information), create usable paths to deep-dive content (Meeting highlights from the LGBTQ Membership Groupâ€™s annual meeting), promote new content from JAMA & their news wire.</p>

					<h2>The Solution </h2>
					<p>This project was a classic website redesign & re-org for a large-scale organization. Over the five-month project we focused on creating a solution that would work as well on the day it launches as it will in several years. A focus was put on creating a strong hierarchy and a flexible design system.</p>

						<h3>Design Research</h3>
						<p>Across several phases of the project we worked with both stakeholders and users to deepen our understanding & validate our findings. The project began with a large group exercise where we discovered both the key goals of the different users of our site as well as the key content from each section (and where it falls within the flows of various user's needs). As the project was on-going, we would often use design exercises (including card sorting and rapid prototyping) to ensure we were finding the best solutions. Nearing the end of the UX phase we conducted several usability studies in a variety of markets to test, improve and validate our designs.</p>

						<h3>Information Architecture</h3>
						<p>TWe worked closely with the content strategy team to digest and organize the wide variety of content. Many tools were used to help create our final sitemap (sticky notes, card sorts, stakeholder interviews, so many excel spreadsheet sitemaps).</p>

						<h3>Template & Modular Design System</h3>
						<p>A master set of 9 templates and nearly 100 individual modules were used to create the final AMA website. Each module was wireframes (across 3 break-points), annotated & put into a master functional requirements document that contained all necessary information.</p>

						<h3>Navigational Pages</h3>
						<p>Many sites try to have their navigational pages do too much work our goal was to get users directly to the content as fast as possible. This put the focus on navigation patterns that work hard (multi-level navigation units; jump navigation for longer content pages)</p>

						<h3>Component Inventory</h3>
						<p>With a project as large as this, it is important to stay organized. We used a variety of tactics, including a large Functional Requirements Document, to ensure that we were accounting for every template, component and page.</p>
