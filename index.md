<h1 id="hello">Hello!</h1>

I’m Sean, a freelance UX designer.

I live in Portland.

(Sorry… Portland, Maine.)

I started my carreer as a front-end developer.

But quickly moved over to the world of UX design & research (the front-end skills come in handy).

I cut my teeth out in SF were I worked with a bunch of awesome shops over 7+ years.

After a few years & several full-time agency jobs, I decided to go freelance. Couldn't be happier with the decision. It lets me focus on the work, it also lets me focus on my not-work.

In 2015 I moved from SF to Chicago. In 2017 I moved from Chicago to Portland. I primarily work remotely, but I always like an excuse to travel.

I am currently **available for projects**.  
& always up to chat about new opportunities.
