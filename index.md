<h1>Hello!</h1>

I’m Sean, a freelance UX designer.

I started my career as a front-end developer. But quickly moved over to the world of UX design & research (the front-end  skills come in handy). I cut my teeth out in SF where I worked with a bunch of awesome shops for 7+ years.

After several full-time agency jobs, I decided to go full-time freelance. Couldn't be happier with the decision. It lets me focus on the work. It also lets me focus on my not-work (which in-turn helps me focus on the work). In 2015 I moved from SF to Chicago. In 2017 I moved from Chicago to Portland (the one in Maine). I primarily work remotely, but I always like an excuse to travel.

I am currently **available for projects** & always up to chat about new opportunities.
