overview: "<p>This is one of those projects that sticks with you. The project began
  with the client pushing to see more out-there explorations and never slowed down
  from there. Every step of the project was exciting as it was challenging. </p><p>Unfortunately,
  this project does not have a happy ending, mid-way through the client decided to
  no longer work with the design team. The UX portion of the project continued for
  several more months until it was completed. However, I am unclear as to the current
  status of the project (I assume the project was shelved, but when we began the project
  the estimated completion was 2018 so one day I may wake up surprised).</p>"
challenge: "<p>Starbucks is a magical brand to work on, the brand loyalty is through
  the roof & the internal teams push to innovate and change. They came to Sapient
  in 2014 with a responsive site and mobile app that many considered best in class.
  The ask was to create a website that was years ahead of any other competitor while
  still driving to stores, online sales and encouraging more loyalty.</p>"
solution: "<p>The design phase of the project had two distinct chapters. The first
  chapter focused on creative exploration & concept development, this is where we
  came up with unique approaches to navigation and content exploration. The second,
  longer, chapter focused on the creation of assets - wireframes, page diagrams, sitemaps
  & flows.</p>"

feature1-title: Creative Exploration
feature1-content: <p>With most redesigns of this scale, you expect to be pushed back
  by the client. After the initial presentation of wireframe and design explorations,
  we were pushed forward. From there we concepted several unique approaches to content
  and navigation.</p> <p>"Dig Dug" (shown) was a design where all elements were shown
  in a priority ranking on the homepage & to dig into deeper content you filtered
  the results. The selected option "Stacker" put the focus on moving both vertically
  & horizontally through the site. </p>

feature2-title: Stacker Page Navigation
feature2-content: "<p>The Stakcer navigation model allowed users to navigate traditionally
  through a site using links and the back button. The real power lied in the ability
  to navigate across sections (from coffee to tea, or from dark roast to light roast).
  This navigational construct was the key concept of the site and was continually
  refined.</p>"

feature3-title: Combining Sales & Marketing
feature3-content: "<p>The existing Starbucks website was siloed between the eCommerce
  experience (get coffee mugs delivered to your house) and the marketing/in-store
  experience (find your closest Starbucks). A lot of effort was put into understanding
  the eCommerce platform and how to streamline product sales. At the same time we
  had to not drive customers away that were simply looking for store hours or their
  rewards points balance. </p>"

feature4-title: Sprint Based Design
feature4-content: "<p>Once the final concept was chosen. We developed a sitemap and
  user stories to ensure our design met all of the criteria. Though we were not partnered
  with an agile development team, this project used stories to ensure that when we
  were designing, we were ensured to design for all pages and corner cases. </p>"

feature5-title: Store Finder
feature5-content: "<p>Designing a store finder for Starbucks is akin to designing
  a Yelp. We needed to come up with a solution that worked just as well across a variety
  of cases, from finding a Reserve location in an urban center, to a drive-through
  store in the suburbs, to just show me the nearest open location. With all the pertinent
  information available from the locator screen, the goal was to make it as fast as
  possible to get to your cup of coffee.</p><p>For those looking for a little bit
  more, we treated the individual store pages as destinations in their own right.
  In addition to hours and an address, we featured content from what beans were being
  featured this month to what track is currently playing. Adding more of a community
  coffee shop vibe, we designed an optional Community Board that could be moderated
  by a store manager.</p>"

my-role: "<p>I started on the project shortly after the discovery/research phase had
  completed. The team was very bare bones for a project this size and consisted of
  a producer, CD, UXD, UX lead (myself) and occasional support from Jr UX designers.
  The concepting portion of the project was collaborative with the CD. The majority
  of the UX deliverables were produced independently. The project plan and client
  communication were primarily handled by myself with feedback and direction from
  the producer and UXD.</p>"
