overview: "<p>This is one of those projects that sticks with you. The project began
  with a mad-dash to create interesting site concepts to only have the client pushing
  to see more out-there explorations. It ended with the design phase of the project
  being removed, with the UX phase left to finish on its own. I am unclear as to the
  status of the project, but hope to wake up one day to find my designs brought to
  life.</p><p>Starbucks is a magical brand to work on, the brand loyalty is through
  the roof & the internal teams push to innovate and change. They came to Sapient
  in 2014 with a responsive site and mobile app that many considered best in class.
  The ask was to create a website that was years ahead of any other competitor while
  still driving to stores, online sales and encouraging more loyalty.</p>"
challenge: "<p>Our goal was to push boundaries, get uncomfortable and create thoughtful
  and game-changing work. We focused on the emotional, tactical and strategic to create
  designs that would not just sell coffee, but go beyond what the expected was.</p>"
solution: "<p>The design phase of the project had two distinct chapters. The first
  chapter focused on creative exploration & concept development â€“ namely, unique approaches
  to navigation and content exploration. The second, longer, chapter focused on the
  creation of assets - wireframes, page diagrams, sitemaps & flows.</p>"

feature1-title: Creative Exploration
feature1-content: <p>With most redesigns of this scale, you expect to be pushed back
  by the client. After the initial presentation of wireframe and design explorations,
  we were pushed forward. From there we concepted several unique approaches to content
  and navigation.</p> <p>"Dig Dug" (shown) was a design where all elements were shown
  in a priority ranking on the homepage & to dig into deeper content you filtered
  the results. The selected option "Stacker" put the focus on moving both vertically
  & horizontally through the site. </p>

feature2-title: Stacker Page Navigation
feature2-content: "<p>The Stakcer navigation model was slightly tamer than some of
  our initial sketches. It allowed users to navigate traditionally through a site
  using links and the back button. However, it also contained the ability to navigate
  horizontally across sections (from coffee to tea, or from dark roast to light roast)
  or vertically to deeper content. This navigational construct was the key concept
  of the site from which all decisions were made.</p>"

feature3-title: Combining Sales & Marketing
feature3-content: "<p>The existing Starbucks website was siloed between the eCommerce
  experience (get coffee mugs delivered to your house) and the marketing/in-store
  experience (find your closest Starbucks). A lot of effort was put into understanding
  the eCommerce platform and how to streamline product sales. At the same time, we
  had to not drive users away that were simply looking for store hours or their rewards
  points balance. </p>"

feature4-title: Sprint Based Design
feature4-content: "<p>Once a concept was chosen, we had to create a plan to implement
  and refine. We developed a sitemap, and from the sitemap, we created user stories
  to ensure our design met all of the criteria. Though we were not partnered with
  an agile development team, the agile approach allowed us to move fast and have built-in
  validation. </p>"

feature5-title: Store Finder
feature5-content: "<p>Designing a store finder for Starbucks is akin to designing
  Yelp. We needed to come up with a solution that worked across a variety of cases.
  If you were trying to find a Reserve location in an urban center, to a drive-through
  store in the suburbs, or just wanted to see the nearest open location, the store
  finder had to work quickly and effectively. With all the primary information available
  directly from the search screen, we wanted to make it as fast as possible to get
  to your cup of coffee.</p><p>For those looking for a little bit more, we treated
  the individual store pages as destinations in their own right. In addition to hours
  and an address, we featured content from what beans were being featured this month
  to what track is currently playing. Adding more of a community coffee shop vibe,
  we designed an optional Community Board that could be moderated by a store manager.</p>"

my-role: "<p>I started on the project shortly after the discovery/research phase had
  completed. The team was very bare bones for a project this size and consisted of
  a producer, CD, UXD and UX lead (myself). I managed the day-to-day and presentations
  of the UX portion of the project, collaborating frequently with the creative team
  &  junior designers. </p>"
