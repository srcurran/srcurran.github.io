overview: "<p>It’s 1982 - A brand new IBM iSeries is put online. This massive mainframe
  computer is going to solve all your problems.</p> \n<p>It’s 2017 - The IBM mainframe
  is still running the show. It is no longer solving all your problems. Updates take
  the system offline for hours, new members get batch uploaded daily, features are
  nearly impossible to implement, daily tasks require deep system knowledge.</p>\n<p>LegalShield
  is a subscription-based legal services provider. It has been around for over 40
  years, and the technology that the platform was built on had started to show its
  age. We were challenged to create a new LegalShield application leaving the technical
  constraints of the past behind us.</p>"
challenge: "<p>Our goal was to re-design the experience on a new platform, from the
  ground up. This project was a “redesign” but felt much more like a new product launch.
  We worked in agile sprints directly with the development team to create the experience
  piece-by-piece. Each decision was concepted, validate, designed and implemented.
  We worked primarily in a siloed manner with bi-weekly reviews provided a chance
  to present our work and findings to the larger organization.</p>"
solution: "<p>Across six months of sprints, we designed out, feature-by-feature an
  MVP across four different connected applications (member, administrator, provider
  and re-seller). Each step of the way was a delicate balance of user, business and
  technology needs. </p>"

feature1-title: Registration & Plan Selection
feature1-content: "<p>We wanted to make it as easy as possible to get access to membership.
  This included&#58; optimizing the registration form (reducing the number of fields,
  using best practice form design), allowing for multiple registration paths & payment
  solutions. In addition to the registration, flows were designed to manage multiple
  account options.</p>"

feature2-title: Communication
feature2-content: "<p>The core of the app is to facilitate connections between you
  and your attorney. We created an experience to facilitate communication between
  members & providers. The experience supported a wide variety of communication means
  including messages, phone calls & form uploads. This same platform was able to be
  abstracted from the outset to support multiple communication paths (member to provider,
  member to administrator, provider to provider). Additional features were designed
  to be implemented as necessary, such as allowing for multiple providers on a single
  case (with internal notes & different statuses), file uploads, chat, and IA workflow
  automation. </p>"

feature3-title: Experience Audits
feature3-content: "<p>With design often happening faster than our small development
  team's velocity, we were able to devote cycles to an in-depth exploration of different
  feature sets (app vs responsive web; freemium vs free-trial, onboarding, personalization,
  etc.) to help us inform future sprints and fill our backlog.</p>"

feature4-title: Multiple Users, Multiple Platforms
feature4-content: "<p>We had to design a system that worked not just *for* multiple
  audiences, but *across* multiple platforms, each with many nuanced use cases.  Members
  would have a legal need & request communication with a law firm; law firms had to
  offload clients that they had conflicts with; operations staff had to support both
  members & providers as well as run metrics. A fourth group, associates, sold plans
  to members & had a complex set of business rules that needed to be accounted for
  & supported in the design system.</p>"

my-role: "<p>I ran the UX portion of the project, working closely with the product
  owner & lead developer to define features, deliverables and the overall focus of
  the project. I worked with a mid-level UX designer & ensured a high-quality final
  product. </p><p>Our team was 100% remote with key players in Maine, Colorado, Washington,
  Oklahoma & NYC. We utilized a wide-variety of applications to facilitate design.</p>"
