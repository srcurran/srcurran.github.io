overview: <p>It’s 1982 - A brand new IBM iSeries is put online & this massive mainframe computer is going to solve all your problems. It’s 2017 - The IBM mainframe is still running the show. Updates take the system offline for a night, new members get batch uploaded daily, new features are nearly impossible to implement, old features require deep system knowledge. </p>

challenge: <p>LegalShield is a subscription-based legal services provider. It has been around for over 40 years, and the technology that the platform was built on had started to show its age. Our task was to re-design the experience on a new platform, from the ground up. This project was a “redesign” but felt much more like a new product launch.</p>

solution: <p>Across six months of sprints, we designed out, feature-by-feature an MVP experience across four different connected applications. Each step of the way required a careful balance of user, business and technology needs. </p>

feature1-title: Registration & Plan Selection
feature1-content: <p>We wanted to make it as easy as possible to get access to membership. This included&#58; optimizing the registration form (x fields, down from xx fields), allowing for multiple registration paths & payment solutions. In addition to the registration, flows were designed to manage multiple account options.</p>

feature2-title: Communication
feature2-content: <p>The core of the app is to facilitate connections between you and your attorney. We created a platform for communication between members & providers that supported messages & documentation of additional communication (phone calls, email), This same platform was able to be optimized from the outset to support multiple providers on a single case (with internal notes & different statuses). We looked at low, medium and high levels of exceptions (With high being implementation of dynamic/IA form creation).</p>

feature3-title: Experience Audits
feature3-content: <p>With design often happening faster than our small development teams velocity, we were able to devote cycles to an in-depth exploration of different feature sets (app vs responsive web; freemium vs free-trial, onboarding, personalization) as well as real-time research on the work we were creating.</p>

feature4-title: Multiple Users, Multiple Platforms
feature4-content: <p>We had to design a system that worked not just *for* multiple audiences, but *across* multiple platforms. Members would have a legal need & need to request communication with a law firm; law firms had to offload clients that they had conflicts with; operations staff had to support both members & providers as well as run metrics. A fourth group, associates, sold plans to members & had a complex set of business rules that needed to be accounted for & supported in the design system.</p>

my-role: <p>I ran the UX portion of the project, working closely with the product owner & lead developer to define features, deliverables and the overall focus of the project. I worked with a mid-level UX designer & ensured a high-quality final product. </p><p>Our team was 100% remote with key players in Maine, Colorado, Washington, Oklahoma & NYC. We utilized a wide-variety of applications to facilitate design.</p>
