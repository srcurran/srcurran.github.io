overview: "<p>Resource Furniture, a longtime leader in high-quality, multifunctional
  furniture. The furniture they sell is thoughtful and elegant, their website, however,
  did not match the product. We were tasked with updating the IA & site design to
  make the website match their offerings.</p>"
challenge: "<p>Our goal was to modernize the site experience to have it exist on the
  same level as the design of their products. The project focused primarily on streamlining
  the information architecture & navigation, as well as focusing on creating elegant,
  simple and timeless designs.</p>"
solution: "<p>This was a quick project with a big impact. The timeline scoped was
  for two weeks, of mostly heads-down work to create 7 unique templates with a variety
  of flexible modules as well as an updated sitemap. </p>"

feature1-title: Quick-Hit Project
feature1-content: "<p>The entire UX phase of the project was scoped for two weeks.
  In such a short timeline we were able to accomplish quite a bit. We conducted stakeholder
  interviews, audited the current site as well as 5 of their top competitors, created
  an updated sitemap, concepted page design and 7 responsive templates (with flexible
  components).</p>"

feature2-title: Product Detail Page
feature2-content: "<p>The most important page of any e-commerce experience is the
  product detail page. This page must convey the key aspects of the product in a way
  that entices the user to purchase. Though RF does not sell from their website, the
  goals we designed against remained.</p><p> We intentionally chose to make the product
  detail page long to make the experience feel elegant, allow the content a lot of
  room to breathe and entice users with details. Calls to learn more exist at both
  the top of the page (for users who know what they are looking for) as well as at
  the bottom of the page (for those who are now convinced to learn more). A tabbed
  detail page keeps content accessible, but, under control.</p>"

feature3-title: Advanced Filtering
feature3-content: "<p>One of the more unique aspects of this project was listing all
  products together (as many of their modular products defy traditional categorization).
  Several navigational approaches were developed to have the product listing page
  be both easy enough for new users, yet, flexible enough for power users.</p>"

  in the short time frame. As the sole UX designer, I ran the project in a fast-paced,
  yet collaborative, manner. I worked closely with both the design and development
  team as well as various stakeholders to ensure all designs were realistic on a tight
  budget and timeline. </p>"
