overview: <p>Resource Furniture, a longtime leader in high-quality, multifunctional furniture. They are seeking a rebrand and redesign of their website to further establish their leadership and convey itself as an avenue for high-end interior design and an aspirational lifestyle. </p>

challenge: <p>Resource Furniture sells incredibly thoughtful & designed products that push the limits of what a murphy bed can do. Their site however, does not match the experience of their products or showrooms. The goal was to make the experience of the site more streamlined, visual and more accurately reflect the brand.</p>

solution: <p>This was a quick project with a big impact. The timeline scoped was for two weeks of mostly heads-down work to create 7 unique templates with a variety of flexible modules as well as an updated sitemap. </p>

feature1-title: Quick-Hit Project
feature1-content: <p>The entire UX phase of the project was scoped for two weeks. In the two weeks I got first-hand information from the client, audited the current site as well as 5 of their top competitors, created an updated sitemap, created 7 responsive templates (with variations) with two rounds of feedback.</p>

feature2-title: Long-Form Product Detail Page
feature2-content: <p>The most important page of any e-commerce experience is the product detail page. This page must convey the key aspects of the product in a way that entices the user to purchase. Though this site does not sell from their website, the goals are the same.</p><p>A long product detail page creates an elegant experience. The content lots of room to breathe and individual features are able to shine. Calls to action are at both the top of the page (for users who know what they are looking for) as well as at the bottom of the page (for those who are now convinced to learn more). A tabbed detail page keeps content accessible, but under control.</p>

feature3-title: Advanced Filtering
feature3-content: <p>One of the more unique aspects of this project was listing all products together (as many of their modular products defy traditional categorization). Several navigational approaches were developed to have the product listing page be both easy enough for new users, yet, flexible enough for power users.</p>

my-role: <p>I was brought in to with the ask to attempt to bring the largest impact in a short time frame. As the sole UX designer, I ran the project in a fast-paced, yet collaboartive, manner. I worked closely with the development team as well as various stakeholders to ensure all designs were realistic on a tight budget and timeline. </p>
