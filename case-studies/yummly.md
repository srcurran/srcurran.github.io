overview: <p>Yummly had an incredible algorithm for diving deep into a wealth of aggregated recipe content. If you needed to find the best gluten-free low-carb chocolate chip cookies, Yummly had you covered. If you were lactose intolerant and never wanted to see  a recipe with dairy in it, you could set it up and be on your way. However, if you were not a power-user & just looking for inspiration for what to eat you were out of luck.</p>

challenge: <p>Yummly’s initial design was barely more than a proof of concept that included a minimal (barren) homepage & a robust (overwhelming) set of search filters. Our goal was to design a web application that worked for a wide set of users.</p>

solution: <p>Working from the ground up to create a web-application that was simple, yet powerful. We based our decisions on user research and created an experience that would work for multiple audiences. We also created designs that worked just as well for low content situations (recipe without a photo, new user profile) as well as it worked for the best-case examples.</p>

feature1-title: Homepage Concepting
feature1-content: <p>The homepage was the initial touch-point for both first-time & returning users & we had to create a page that did a lot of work. We created sketches of several different approaches - “Recommendation Engine” grouped liked concepts in a Netflix style (kale & garlic side-dishes), “Friend Feed” populated the homepage with content liked by users you follow (or power users for those new to the experience), “Food Trend” was an approach that put a weekly focus on an in-season ingredient (rhubarb) or a specific event (Fourth of July BBQ).</p>

feature2-title: Designing for Mindsets
feature2-content: <p>We designed the site to work not for unique personas, but rather different mindsets, understanding that in a single session a person could jump between several modes.</p><ul><li><strong>Search for the Best:</strong> &ldquo;I want to make the best chocolate chip cookies&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Looking for Inspiration:</strong> &ldquo;I just want to see lots of great photos to inspire dishes I make in the future&rdquo;</li><li><strong>What can i Make from my Fridge:</strong> &ldquo;I have chicken &amp; kale that I need to use tonight, what should I make&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Taste Profile Builder:</strong> &ldquo;I love that Yummly learns what I like &amp; tailors recipes for my needs showing me recipes that I want to actually make&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Recipe Box:</strong> &ldquo;I use Yummly to store all of my recipes, it makes it so easy to come back to &amp; find what I am looking for&rdquo;</li></ul>

feature3-title: Yum
feature3-content: <p>Each recipe on the previous site had no less than 5 interaction points - A &ldquo;Save&rdquo; button, an &ldquo;I’m Interested&rdquo; button, a rating, Facebook “like” & email. Many of these buttons were vague, had user-intention overlap (what case determines when I&#58; save, like or click i’m interested) & many had no easy way to surface previously “i’m interested” recipes. Our solution was to combine as many features as possible into one branded experience. Clicking “Yum” would save the recipe to you profile, it would signal to others that you are interested in the recipe, it would populate on the Facebook social graph & add importance/weighting to the individual recipe.</p>

feature4-title: Onboarding
feature4-content: <p>Yummly is a powerful application &amp; becomes more powerful the more you interacted with the platform. To help facilitate we created a light-touch onboarding that began to move your preferences upon registration.</p>

my-role: <p>I was the sole/lead UX designer. I worked closely with the leadership team at Yummly to ensure that we were tracking each step of the way. Working with the Yummly team was very collaborative, often including sketches that took over walls that became more and more refined as the project moved forward.</p>
