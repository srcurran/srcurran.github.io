overview: "<p>When Yummly came to us, they had an incredible algorithm for diving
  deep into a wealth of aggregated recipe content. If you needed to find the best
  gluten-free low-carb vegan chocolate chip cookies, Yummly had you covered. If you
  were lactose intolerant and never wanted to see a recipe with dairy in it, you could
  set it up and be on your way. However, if you were not a power-user & just looking
  for what to make for dinner, you were out of luck.</p>"
challenge: "<p>Yummly’s initial design was barely more than a proof of concept that
  included a minimal homepage that borrowed heavily from Google Search & a robust
  (overwhelming) set of search filters. Our goal was to take their incredible technology
  and layer on a simple, visual interface to humanize the content.</p>"
solution: "<p>Working from the ground up to create a web-application that was simple,
  yet powerful. We began with user research, which informed our decisions, and began
  to create an experience that would work for multiple user mindsets. Page designs
  were simple, yet flexible, designed to work just as well for low content as ideal
  cases. User flows (over a traditional sitemap) were focused with the goal of reducing
  clicks and increasing engagement.</p>"

feature1-title: Homepage Concepting
feature1-content: "<p>The homepage was the initial touch-point for both first-time
  & returning users. It had to set up what Yummly is, but it also had to get users
  into the content. We had to create a page that could work hard. Sketches of several
  different approaches were made – “Recommendation Engine” grouped liked concepts
  in a Netflix style (kale & garlic side-dishes), “Friend Feed” populated the homepage
  with content liked by users you follow (or power users for those new to the experience),
  “Food Trend” was an approach that put a weekly focus on an in-season ingredient
  (rhubarb) or a specific event (Fourth of July BBQ).</p>"

feature2-title: Designing for Mindsets
feature2-content: "<p>We did not design against personas, rather, we designed against
  different user mindsets. With mindsets we acknowledged that users do not perform
  a task one specific way and may even change their approach several times in a single
  session.</p><ul><li><strong>Search for the Best:</strong> &ldquo;I want to make
  the best chocolate chip cookies&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Looking for Inspiration:</strong>
  &ldquo;I just want to see lots of great photos to inspire dishes I make in the future&rdquo;</li><li><strong>What
  can I Make from my Fridge:</strong> &ldquo;I have chicken &amp; mushrooms that I
  need to use tonight, what should I make&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Taste Profile Builder:</strong>
  &ldquo;I love that Yummly learns what I like &amp; tailors recipes for my needs
  showing me recipes that I want to actually make&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Recipe Box:</strong>
  &ldquo;I use Yummly to store all of my recipes, it makes it so easy to come back
  to &amp; find what I am looking for&rdquo;</li></ul>"

feature3-title: Yum
feature3-content: "<p>Each recipe on the previous site had no less than 5 interaction
  points - A &ldquo;Save&rdquo; button, an &ldquo;I’m Interested&rdquo; button, a
  rating, Facebook “like” & email. These buttons were vague with no clear distinction
  (should I click save, like, or, I’m interested?) and once interacted with, there
  was no easy way to find again.</p><p> Our solution was to combine as many features
  as possible into one branded experience. Clicking “Yum” would save the recipe to
  your profile, it would signal to others that you are interested in the recipe, it
  would populate on the Facebook social graph & increment the yum counter on the recipe.</p>"

feature4-title: Onboarding
feature4-content: "<p>Yummly is a powerful application &amp; becomes more powerful
  the more you interacted with the platform. To help facilitate we created a light-touch
  onboarding that began to populate your preferences upon registration.</p><p>Understanding
  that onboarding doesn't end after the first session, micro interactions were designed
  to increase engagement, time on site and enjoyment</p>"

my-role: "<p>I was the sole UX designer. I worked closely with our design team and
  the leadership team at Yummly. Working with the Yummly team was very collaborative,
  often including sketches that took over walls that became more and more refined
  as the project moved forward.</p>"
