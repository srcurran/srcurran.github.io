overview: "<p>The American Medical Association is the largest organization of physicians
  in the United States. The organization manages large aspects of our health care
  system from CPT codes (how doctors get paid) to FREIDA (how medical students find
  internships) to lobbying for the healthcare industry. Unsurprisingly this had the
  effect of a site with so much, and such varied, content, that it was hard for users
  to find what they were looking for. </p>"
challenge: "<p>Our primary goal was to make a site that was accessible in both design
  (from users on phones to users with disabilities) and content (let me find what
  I am looking for). We designed against several key metrics to ensure our success&#58;
  Increase member registration, allow fast access to key content areas (continuing
  medical education, fellowship database, CPT information), create usable paths to
  deep-dive content (Meeting highlights from the LGBTQ Membership Groupâ€™s annual meeting),
  allow quick access to new content from JAMA & their newswire.</p>"
solution: "<p>This was a classic website redesign & re-org for a large-scale organization.
  It started with understanding both the business and the users. We then focused on
  creating a site structure, navigation, and taxonomy that supported all of the site
  content. As well as, creating a simple, yet flexible, design system that would work
  not only at launch, but five years in the future.</p>"

feature1-title: Design Research
feature1-content: "<p>Across several phases of the project, we worked with both stakeholders
  and users to deepen our understanding & validate our findings. The project began
  with a large group exercise where we discovered both the key goals of the different
  users of our site as well as the key content from each business owner (and where
  the key content fell on the flows of various user's needs).</p> <p>To validate our
  design in real-time we would often use design exercises (including card sorting
  and rapid prototyping) to ensure we were finding the best solutions. Nearing the
  end of the UX phase we conducted several usability studies in a variety of markets
  to test, improve and validate our designs.</p>"

feature2-title: Information Architecture
feature2-content: "<p>We worked closely with the content strategy team to digest and
  organize the wide variety of content. UX owned the navigation and sitemap, where
  Content Strategy owned the site-wide taxonomy. All available tools were used to
  help us get to our final sitemap (sticky notes, card sorts, stakeholder interviews,
  and an uncountable number of spreadsheet sitemap iterations).</p>"

feature3-title: Template & Modular Design System
feature3-content: "<p>A master set of 9 templates and nearly 100 individual modules
  were used to create the final AMA website. Each module was wireframes (across 3
  break-points), and annotated. The final deliverable was a master functional requirements
  document that spanned over 100 pages.</p>"

feature4-title: Navigational Pages
feature4-content: "<p>Our goal was to get users directly to the content as fast as
  possible. This put the focus on navigation patterns that do a lot of heavy lifting
  including modules with exposed sub-navs, jump navigation for longer content pages,
  and support for multiple pathways.</p>"

feature5-title: Component Inventory
feature5-content: "<p>With a project as large as this, it is important to stay organized.
  We used a variety of tactics, including a large Functional Requirements Document,
  to ensure that we were accounting for every template, component, and page.</p>"

my-role: "<p>As lead designer, I worked closely with the content strategy team, additional
  UX designers & visual design to ensure that the system was built to support the
  design. </p>"
